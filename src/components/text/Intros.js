        In this simple application we can add and delete todos from a list.
        There are several small tests we can do on top of this application, and
        they illustrate element selection and data handling. In order to cover
        most cases, we should add a list of items to the todo-list, and then
        remove the list of items again.

        In this section we repeat the same exercise as in sorted list, but
        allowing the list items to be added to a random position in the list.
        This adds complexity when identifying the elements to remove.

        This is a super-simple game where simply pressing the right button will
        result in success. We make the game harder by having buttons that
        scramble the button id, class, content and order attributes,
        respectively. This game, which is simple for a human to play, can be
        surprisingly hard for a machine to play, as they often rely on
        attributes hidden in the HTML, such as class and id.

        This is a simple game where you can change the action labels that
        manipulate something in your data model. In a typical SaaS application,
        this could, for example, be Project, User or Bank Account - here
        represented by Kangaroo, Koala, or Dolphin. The trick is to let your
        test automation tool still find the buttons even if the wording is
        changing, but only affecting the appropriate buttons.
