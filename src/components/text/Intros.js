        In this simple application we can add and delete todos from a list.
        There are several small tests we can do on top of this application, and
        they illustrate element selection and data handling. In order to cover
        most cases, we should add a list of items to the todo-list, and then
        remove the list of items again.

      <p>
        In this section we repeat the same exercise as in sorted list, but
        allowing the list items to be added to a random position in the list.
        This adds complexity when identifying the elements to remove.
